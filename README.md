#COMP306 API Engineering & Cloud Computing Assignment 3

##Machine Learning Basics
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the basics of machine learning by:
- Importing Data into a Python Application using `sklearn` package and datasets from online repositories (e.g. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=attUp&view=table)
- Using Decision Trees for the purpose of Classification
- Train a Classifier
- Demo the Classifier in a Simple Web Application

>*NOTE:* **Decision Trees** are a type of **Supervised Machine Learning** where we explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data.
